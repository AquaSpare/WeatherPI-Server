# WeatherPi-Server

WeatherPi-Server is the backend component of a weather data collection and visualization system. Built using FastAPI, this server is designed to receive, process, and store environmental data sent from Raspberry Pi-based weather stations. The server provides a robust API for data submission, retrieval, and supports a dashboard interface for real-time weather monitoring. Its goal is to offer an accessible, efficient, and scalable way to handle IoT weather data for hobbyists and educational purposes.
